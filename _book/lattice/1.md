#### Basic Definitions and Minkowski's Theorem

Lattice has two equivalent definitions.

**Def.(Lattice)** An $$n$$-dimensional *lattice* is any subset of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ that is both an *additive subgroup* and *discrete*.

**Def.(Lattice)** Given $$k$$ linearly independent vectors $$\mathbf B=\{\mathbf{b}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{b}_k\}$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, a lattice is the set of integer linear combinations of these vectors:
$$
\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L(\mathbf{B})}:=\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbb{Z}^k = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k z_i\mathbf{b}_i: z_i\in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
$$
$$\mathbf{B}$$ is called a *basis* of the lattice, and $$k$$ is called the *rank* of the basis, which is an invariant of the lattice. If $$k=n$$, the lattice is called to be *full-rank*. Any lattice is * *
